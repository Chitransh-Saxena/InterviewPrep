For Each
    -> By default, we have external for loops
    -> List<Integer> li = {1,2,3,4,5};
        for(Integer x: li) {

            SOP(x);
        }
    
    -> Above will work just fine and is called external for loop
    -> From Java 8, we have internal loop
        -> li.forEach(i -> SOP(i));
        -> Advantage
            -> This is much faster than external for loop.
