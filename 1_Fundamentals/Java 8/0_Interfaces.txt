Interface
    -> Interface can have non-abstract methods.
        -> Body is allowed.
        -> This is only allowed with default keyword (use the keyword 'default')
        -> Advantage?
    -> Multiple inheritence (not fixed though)
        -> In previous version (before Java 8)
            -> If a class is implementing two interfaces and both have some common entity or attribute
                -> Then it was compulsary to implement that method in this current class
        -> From Java 8
            -> If we implement two interfaces which have defined (with body) some method
                -> Diamond problem will arise
                -> Only way to fix that is by using our own definition of the method.
    -> If there is an interface with some method show() with body and a class Parent with the same method and some body
        -> And now we create a class which extends Parent and implements Inteface
            -> Which show() method will be called?
                -> The one which Parent class has, class has more power as compared to interface in this case.
    -> You cannot override methods which are already present in the object class.
