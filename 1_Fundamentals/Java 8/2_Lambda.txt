Lambdas
    -> These are single line inline functions.
    -> In previous text (1_ForEach), internal for loop is shown like this
        -> list.forEach(i -> SOP(i));
        -> Above was made possible using lambda expression
        -> LHS of the '->' is parameter and RHS is expression
    -> Example;
        A obj;
        obj = () -> SOP("hey");

        OR

        obj = (i) -> SOP(i);;
    -> Lambda is implementation of consumer interface.
