Lambda Functions
    -> It is a one line function.
    -> It is inline (in C++)
    -> Ex.
        -> int sum (int a, int b) {
                return a + b;
        }

        -> So, now if we have a list of numbers where we want to perform this operation of addition
        ArrayList<Integer> li = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4));

        li.forEach((item) -> SOP (item + 1));

        -> here item represents each item one by one.
    -> LHS of arrow has parameters and RHS of the array contains the body of the function.
