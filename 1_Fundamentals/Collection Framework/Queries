HashSet
StringBuffer

In HashSet, I am adding a String, and getting size of set. I get a certain number (correct according to leetcode)
In same hashSet, if I add StringBuffer, do some operations, and then I get size of HashSet, I get different answer.

Is there a reason for this to happen? In first scenario, new StringBuffer variable is created, operations are done and toString() method is used to store in set.
	-> Two StringBuffer objects are different objects despite having the same arguments. Therefore HashSet just adds the StringBuffers instead of ignoring duplicates.

TreeMap, under what conditions is it better than HashMap
LinkedHashMap
Basically both Maps and Sets.
HashMap vs HashTable usage.


HashMap
	-> putIfAbsent
		-> Working and time complexity

	-> computeIfAbsent()


TreeSet

What is time complexity of using iterators?
	-> How do iterators internally work?
