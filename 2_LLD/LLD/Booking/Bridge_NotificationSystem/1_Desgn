Abstract Class: Notification
    -> TextMessage
    -> QRMessage

Implementations of above
    -> SMS
    -> Email
    -> Whatsapp

NotificationSender
    -> This will be a separate interface used to actually send the notification
    -> Since this is an interface, it will require some imlementation
        -> The implementations will be
            -> SMS
            -> Email
            -> Whatsapp

We pass the NotificationSender to Notification abstraction
