    -> Bridge Design Pattern
        -> Basically, if there is one class which has to implement multiple functionalities (interfaces), we have multiple options to do stuff
            -> One traditional way would be to make final classes implementing both or multiple interfaces

        -> If there is a Shape class, and it has two child classes "Square" and "Rectangle"
