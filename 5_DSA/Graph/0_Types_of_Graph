What are graphs and what are different types of graphs that we have

* Graph is a data structure where multiples nodes are connected to each other.
* Each node could be represented as a unit of data which contains some main information and information about it's connections
* So, a typical graph has 2 components
  * A Node (or a vertex)
  * An edge (This is a connection between 2 nodes)
  
Types of Graphs

* Undirected graph
  * The edges do not have any sense of direction
  * They only represent a connection between nodes
  * So, for example, if we have 2 nodes u and v. The edge between them could be represented as uv as well as vu
* Directed Graph
  * In directed graph, the direction of traversal matters.
  * So, if we have 2 nodes, u and v, and the directional edge is from u to v, then the edge could only be represented as uv and not vu
    * This means, we can only go from u to v, and not come back


Degrees of a graph
  * Number of edges that are incoming or outgoing in a graph
    * If the graph is undirected, we count all the edges that are connected to it
  * We have a mathematical property here too
    * The total degree in a undirected graph = 2 * total number of edges (not nodes or vertices)
    
Path in a graph
  * Sequence of nodes in a graph such that none of them are repeated when traversed.
    * This goes for both directed and undirected graph

Cyclic Undirected Graph
  * If we can reach the same node from which we started, then there is a cycle in the graph

Acyclic Undirected graph?
  * It is a tree (think and visualize)
  
Cyclic Directed Graph
  * Same logic, if we are able to reach the start node again, then there is a cycle in the graph
    * This should be applicable to all the nodes (we should be able to start from each node and reach that node again)

Directed Acyclic Graph
  * Also majorly known as DAG
    * Remember good old days of Airflow?
  * Directed graph, without any cycle.
  

Weighted Graph
  * The edge between nodes have some sort of weight or some number associated with them indicating some or the other factor
  * These could be undirected as well as directed too.
