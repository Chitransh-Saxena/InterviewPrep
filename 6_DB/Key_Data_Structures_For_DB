Skiplist
  -> Data structure that is used to implement Sorted Set
  -> Alternative to a balanced tree
    -> Allows faster insertion, deletion operations
  -> Redis used skiplist to implemented sorted set (ordered data structure)
    -> Can skip elements based on requirement
    -> Range based queries can be performed optimally


HashIndex or HashTable
  -> Effeciently map keys to values while generatingg hash value for each key
  -> Hash index is basically index in an array where the nodes are stored
    -> Thus the time to reach a node is basically calculating hash index and reaching there {takes O(1)} time
    -> Faster searches, insertions and deletions
  -> Used in Redis, MySql etc.

SSTable and LSM Tree
-> SSTable
  -> Sorted String Table
  -> Store data on disk in sorted order
    -> File based data strucuture to store large amounts of data in highly effecient data format
  -> SSTable is a core component of LSM Tree, apart from Memtable

-> Memtable
  -> In-memory data structure that stores reads and writes

-> SSTable and Memtable work hand in hand to operate on high volumes of read and writes
  -> LSM Tree is basically the secret sauce behind the NoSQL databases.
-> LSM Tree
  -> Backbone of NoSQL DBs like cassandra, RocksDB, levelDB
  

BTree
  -> B tree is a balanced tree where each node can have multiple children and keep data sorted
  -> B+ Tree is a special type of tree where all data is stored in the leaf nodes, and other nodes only store the keys which lead to data.
    -> Used in MySQL, PGSQL, Oracle to handle the large amount of on-disk data
  
Inverted Index
  -> Search and retrieve data from large collection of text documents
  -> Creates a mapping of words to documents in which they appear
    -> Index is inverted because it maps words to document, and not the other way round
  -> Used in document search engines like ElasticSearch


Suffix Tree
  -> High Speed Text Searches
    -> Like Trie and stuff

R-Tree
  -> Spatial index data structure
    -> Organises data based on their geometric boundaries
  -> Used to effeciently store and retreive spatial data in a database
    -> Faster spatial queries
    -> Mostly used in spatial DBs like postGIS, MongoDB, ElasticSearch
