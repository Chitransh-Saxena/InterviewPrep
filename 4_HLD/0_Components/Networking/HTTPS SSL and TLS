HTTPS is HTTP protocol with an encryption

S stands for secure

How is this security implemented?
-> SSL/TLS

-> SSL
    -> Secure Socket Layer
    -> This protocol came in 1995 from Netscape
    -> It had versions 1, 2 and 3

-> TLS
    -> In 1999, Netscape gave control of SSL to IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force)
    -> That year, TLS 1.0 was released (which was essentially SSL 3.1)
