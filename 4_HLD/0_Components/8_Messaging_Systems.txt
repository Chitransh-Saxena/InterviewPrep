What are async messaging systems

-> An asynchronous system could be seen as a environment of multiple entities which do not rely on each other for processing
-> They have well defined set of events, and basically follow a Event Driven Architecture
    -> Components perform specified events based on the occurence of the events

How does Message Queue Come in place?
    -> How do these separate entities know about events?
    -> There would be nodes which are always listening for new requests, which are basically in certain format, coming from the message queue
    -> Sometimes immediate response is not expected

    Models of MQ
    -> Producer Consumer Model
        -> BlockingQueue is used
        -> Producer knows about what has to be consumed, from where it has to be consumed, how much has to be consumed
    -> Publish - Subscribe Model
        -> Subscribers subscribe to a topic
        -> When a message is published to that topic, the subscribers actually process the request
