Indexing is the way of examining the rows when searching for some certain data

Could be performed in multiple ways
    -> Like Sorting on the bases of primary key which is integer, so a basic binary search would do the job for us
    -> There could be a way of storing the data in the form of Binary Tree

    -> Hashing is another concept, when our key is a non-int type

CREATE INDEX name_index ON Employee (Employee_Name)
CREATE INDEX name_index ON Employee (Employee_Name, Employee_Age)
