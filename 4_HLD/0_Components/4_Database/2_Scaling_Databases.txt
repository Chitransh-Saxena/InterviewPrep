There are different ways to scale a database

1. Master - Slave Replication
2. Master - Master Replication
3. Federation
4. Sharding
5. Denormalization
6. SQL Tuning



Master - Slave Replication
    -> When a write happens, it happens to master
    -> This is then replicated to slave nodes

    -> So, read happens from either slave or master nodes
    -> But write happens only to master nodes

Master - Master Replication

    -> These are basically 2 DBs serving same requests
        -> Kinda like horizontal scaling with RAID mirroring

Federation

    -> Database is split into multiple based on categories
    -> This results in less read and write traffic for all.

Sharding 
    -> Different Rows are stored in differnt physical machines
    -> Helps lower the traffic to one server
