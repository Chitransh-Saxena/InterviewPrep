            -> Design Alexa find my phone's location
                -> I did not choose DB correctly (Check AlexaFindMy.java in HLD folder)
            -> Nielsen Architecture in Depth

        DSA
            -> Design Patterns basics
            -> Top K Frequent Elements
                -> Grilled a lot on internal complexity of each approach
                -> Time complexity analysis, why and how of each approach
                -> Which one is best
                    -> How to optimise even further

            -> Given a binary tree, find cousins of a given node
                -> Apart from the node that comes from same parent (sibling node), find all other nodes on same level basically
                    -> My approach was storing the BFS in a 2-D list
                        -> TC for 2-D list got a little messed up


        Major Takeaways
            -> DP Hard level
                -> Eventually Consistent, not Strongly Consistent.
            -> Internal working of collection framework and whatever I am using
            -> Time complexity of library functions
                -> What action is performed in those library functions
                -> How to customize it
                    -> Comparator, Comparable etc.
            -> In HLD, got a little nervous, and gave answer in a hurry because time was less
                -> Should have taken a little pause, thought about it and then should have said something
