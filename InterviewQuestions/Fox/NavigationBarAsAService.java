-> Open Amazon.com and DisneyHotstar.com
    -> Both of these use a hamburger type navigation bar (3 horizontal lines)
    -> We are a service provider which are providing navigation bar as a service
        -> This can include horizontal navigation tabs, hamburger style, etc.
    -> High Level Design of Such system
        -> How to store the data.
        -> How the flow will work

    -> This is a Multi Tenancy Architecture in BE which uses CQRS microservices pattern
        -> I did not know about any of these, so the solution I gave for this cannot be directly used
        -> I need to revisit the approach based on above patterns of architecture and microservices
            -> Clarity
                -> Multi Tenancy can be achieved on many levels (networking, database, application, Disk etc.)
                -> In this case, it would be on database side

    -> Again, this is a cool project that can be made.
