Beans that Spring creates are managed by IoC (Application Context).
We can get info about the bean from ApplicationContext.

If we want some bean and use it for some reason, apart from doing Autowired stuff, we can do this as well.


psvm(String[] args) {

    ApplicationContext context = SpringApplication.run(MyApplicationName.class, args);
    SomeClassWhoseBeanINeed obj = context.getBean(SomeClassWhoseBeanINeed.class);

    SomeExpectedReturnType result = obj.someMethod(someArgs);

}

-> SpringApplication.run returns the ApplicationContext object.
-> ApplicationContext object can be used to ask for Bean of the provided class in arguments.
-> Bean (just an object btw), can be used in a regular way to call methods and work with them.
