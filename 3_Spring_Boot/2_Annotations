Annotations
-> These are kind of metadata, that provide info / data about the program
-> They provide supplemental information about the program

@RestController vs @Controller
-> @Controller
  -> It is a specialization of @Component annotation
  -> It denotes that the current class serves as a controller.
  -> It is usually combined with @RequestMapping annotation
  -> The annotation basically indicates the role of the class
    -> The dispatcher scans such annotated classesa for mapped methods and detects any @RequestMapping
      -> These are nothing but get, post requests code.

-> @RestController
  -> Helps in creating restful webservices.
  -> This is used at class level, and allows the class to handle client's requests
  -> It allows us to handle REST APIs such as GET, POST and all that
  
-> Differences
  -> @RestController is a special @Controller used in RESTful web-services
    -> It is combination of @ReponseBody and @Controller
  -> @Controller is specialized version of @Component, whereas @RestController is specialized version of @Controller
  -> @Controller, we can return a view in MVC, we cannot do that with @RestController
  ->
